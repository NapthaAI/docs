## Welcome to Naptha!

**Letâ€™s build agents of change to help everyone realize the potential of collaborative intelligence.**

Naptha is a framework and infrastructure for developing and running massive multi-agent systems across many devices. Our mission is to reimagine the web in order to support next-generation AI applications and use cases.

### Benefits
*Decentralized* multi-agent workflows can run on one or more nodes (rather than on just one central server), involving different LLMs and local data sources.

* **Privacy:** Leverage proprietary data securely while working with other agents.
* **Efficiency:** Running multi-agent systems across many nodes is more cost effective than a centralized approach.
* **Diversity:** Facilitate interactions among agents made by various people.

Overall, the Naptha web not only enables scaling *within* organizations and platforms, but also *between* different organizations and platforms.
