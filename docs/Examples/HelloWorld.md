# Hello World

Start your journey with Naptha by running a simple Hello World example. This introductory example demonstrates the basics of running an agent on a Naptha node.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- [Naptha SDK](/GettingStarted/Installation) installed and configured

### Modules Used

This basic, single-node workflow is made of the following component, which you can find on the Naptha GitHub:

* [Hello World](https://github.com/NapthaAI/hello_world_agent)

## Run

You can run this "Hello World" example using the Naptha CLI with the following command:

```bash
# usage: naptha run <agent_name> <agent args>
naptha run agent:hello_world_agent -p "firstname=sam surname=altman"
```

### Configuration Options:
- `firstname`: The first name to use in the greeting
- `surname`: The last name to use in the greeting

:::note
This will run on whichever node you've configured as `NODE_URL` in the .env file of the Naptha SDK.
:::

## Expected Output

The agent will respond with a personalized greeting using the provided name parameters.

:::tip
Try modifying the name parameters to see how the agent responds with different inputs!
