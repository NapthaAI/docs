# Naptha AI Documentation Style Guide (v1)

N.B This is a living document.

This document is a style guide for writing documentation for the Naptha AI platform. 

## Voice and Tone

### Core Principles
- **Clear**: Write in simple, direct language
- **Technical**: Maintain professional accuracy
- **Empowering**: Focus on enabling developers
- **Collaborative**: Emphasize how modules can be composed and built upon

### Voice Characteristics
- Technical but accessible
- Professional but friendly
- Direct but supportive

## Writing Style

### General Guidelines
- Use active voice (when possible)
- Write in the present tense (when possible)
- Keep sentences concise
- Avoid jargon unless technically necessary

### Technical Writing
- Start with the goal or outcome
- Provide context before details
- Include relevant code examples
- Link to related documentation
- Use consistent terminology

## Formatting

### Headers
- Use title case for main titles
- Use sentence case for subheadings
- Follow markdown hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3)
- Keep headers concise and descriptive

### Code Blocks
```python
# Use syntax highlighting
def example_function():
    """Include docstrings for Python examples"""
    pass
```

### Lists
- Use bullet points for unordered lists
- Use numbers for sequential steps
- Maintain a parallel structure
- Start with action verbs

## Documentation Structure

### Page Layout
1. Title
2. Brief description
3. Prerequisites (if applicable)
4. Main content
5. Related resources - Suggestions, Troubleshooting, etc.
6. Next steps

### Content Organization
- Organize content from simple to complex
- Group related information
- Use clear section breaks
- Include navigation aids

## Language Conventions

### Terminology
- Use "Naptha" for the platform and SDK
- Use "module" for individual components
- Maintain glossary of technical terms (WIP)


## Visual Elements

### Screenshots
- Use clear, focused screenshots
- Include captions
- Highlight relevant areas
- Maintain consistent resolution

### Diagrams
- Use simple, clean designs
- Include legends when necessary and possible
- Maintain a consistent color scheme
- Label all components

## Code Examples

### Format
```python
# Include comments
# Use consistent indentation
def example():
    """Include docstring"""
    return True
```

### Best Practices
- Keep examples minimal (and if relevant, complete)
- Include error handling
- Show both basic (and, if relevant, advanced) usage
- Use real-world scenarios

## Links and References

### Internal Links
- Use relative paths
- Include context in link text
- Check for broken links
- Cross-reference related content

### External Links

- Verify link stability
- Include link purpose

- Include version numbers
- Note deprecated features
- Highlight breaking changes

### Compatibility
- Note system requirements
- List dependencies
- Specify supported versions
- Include upgrade guides

## Review Process
