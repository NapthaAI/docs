# Contributing to Naptha Infrastructure

Welcome to the Naptha AI community! We're excited to have you contribute to building the future of multi-agent AI systems.

Agents and other AI modules typically require many infrastructure components to run. This guide will help you become a contributor to Naptha's infrastructure through these steps:

1. Understand the Naptha Node
2. Run a Naptha Node
3. Create your first contribution to the Naptha Node
4. Become a core contributor to the Naptha Node

## Understand the Naptha Node

Naptha Nodes package everything that your agent needs to run modules like agents locally, and allow your agent to interact with other agents in the network. Core components include:

- **Inference**: Run a variety of open source models locally
- **Servers**: Allow your agent to interact with other agents in the network
- **Storage**: Store state such as knowledge and memory
- **Orchestration**: Use message queues and asynchronous processing to orchestrate agents and modules

For comprehensive information about the Naptha Node, see the [Naptha Node Overview](/docs/NapthaNodes/0-quickstart.md).

## Run a Naptha Node

To run a Naptha Node locally, follow the instructions in the [Naptha Node README](https://github.com/NapthaAI/node).

## Create your first contribution to the Naptha Node

Help improve our core infrastructure:

- Add features or integrations to [Naptha Node](https://github.com/NapthaAI/node) and [Naptha SDK](https://github.com/NapthaAI/naptha-sdk)
