## Build Your Own Agent

Napthaville Tutorial
Project planning: Napthaville

This guide walks through the steps to create and run an Agent on a single Naptha node. 

Create an Agent by defining its unique persona.
Submit a pull request on GitHub to become a citizen.
Run interactive simulations with generative agents.
Build your own world by customizing our example.

The following is based on “Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior.”
Step 1: Create Your Own Agent
An Agent represents an entity that can be configured to respond to a user's messages using several parameters like model, instructions, and tools.
Step 2: Submit a Pull Request
A Building represents a conversation between a user and one or many Assistants. You can create a Thread when a user (or your AI application) starts a conversation with your Assistant.
Step 3: Run Simulations
The contents of the messages your users or applications create are added as Message objects to the Thread. Messages can contain both text and files.
Step 4: Build a New World
Once all the user Messages have been added to the Thread, you can Run the Thread with any Assistant. Creating a Run uses the model and tools associated with the Assistant to generate a response. These responses are added to the Thread as assistant Messages.
