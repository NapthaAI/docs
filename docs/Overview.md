## Welcome to Naptha!

**Letâ€™s build cooperative AI agents for everyone.**

Naptha is a framework and infrastructure for developing and running massive multi-agent systems across many devices. Our mission is to reimagine the web in order to support next-generation AI applications and use cases.

### Benefits
Distributed multi-agent workflows can run on one or more Naptha nodes (rather than on just one central server), using a variety of LLMs and local data sources.

* **Privacy:** Leverage proprietary data securely while working with other agents.
* **Efficiency:** Decentralize your AI systems to achieve better performance at scale.
* **Diversity:** Facilitate more interactions between agents made by different people.

Overall, the Naptha web not only enables growth *within* organizations and platforms, but also *across* various organizations and platforms.
