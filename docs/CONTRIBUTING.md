# Contributing to Naptha

Welcome to the Naptha AI community! We're excited to have you contribute to building the future of multi-agent AI systems. This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üåü Ways to Contribute

### 1. Exploring Naptha
Before diving into development, we recommend exploring the platform by:
- [Setting up and running a Naptha node locally](https://github.com/NapthaAI/node)
- Testing existing modules and providing feedback
- Suggesting UX improvements

:::info
You can check our [Github repositories](https://github.com/orgs/NapthaAI/repositories?type=all) for existing modules.
:::

### 2. Develop Modules
Modules are building blocks for Naptha's distributed multi-agent ecosystem. Different types of contributors can help:

**For AI Developers:**
- Build agent and orchestrator modules

**For Application Developers:**
- Build environment modules for agents modules to interact with

**For AI Users:**
- Create a persona module:
  For example, you can create a persona module by exporting your X (Twitter) data and adding it to the Personas dataset on Naptha's collections. This allows you to create an AI agent that mimics your communication style and preferences. Here's an [example of a persona generated from twitter data](https://huggingface.co/collections/NapthaAI/twitter-personas-673468b711e26ee8df2e36d6).

:::info
- Check out modules that we need via open issues with the module label on the [module contributor board](https://github.com/orgs/NapthaAI/projects/3/views/1).
- We also have [weekly module developer calls](https://naptha.ai/events) you can join.
:::

### 3. Contribute to Naptha Stack
Help improve our core infrastructure:
- Add features or integrations to [Naptha Node](https://github.com/NapthaAI/node) and [Naptha SDK](https://github.com/NapthaAI/naptha-sdk)
- Fix bugs and improve performance

:::info
- You can track progress and find infrastructure-related tasks on our [Infrastructure Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/NapthaAI/projects/2/views/1).
