# Use Cases

Here are some inspiring use cases for Naptha builders:

## Multiplayer Coding & Collaboration
Build powerful collaborative systems where:
- Hundreds of specialized agents run across multiple nodes
- Humans work in-the-loop with AI agents
- Teams collaborate on software development tasks

Frameworks like MetaGPT demonstrate how specialized agent systems improve performance:
- Engineer agents for implementation
- Architect agents for system design
- Product Manager agents for requirements
- QA agents for testing

Traditionally, these agent systems were limited to running on a single node, making true collaboration difficult. Currently, AI devs work with agents locally but thereâ€™s no way for them to collaborate across the Web with other human-AI pairs.

## Large-Scale Simulations
Based on Stanford's groundbreaking generative agents research:
- Simulate millions/billions of agents
- Leverage idle compute on laptops and phones
- Pay only for electricity costs

Recent applications include:
- Economic behavior modeling
- Market research simulations
- Twitter engagement prediction
- Public opinion analysis
- Historical event simulations

## Synthetic Data Generation
Create powerful data frameworks using LLMs to:
- Curate existing datasets
- Process raw data
- Generate new training data
- Synthesize edge cases
