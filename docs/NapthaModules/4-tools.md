# Tool Modules

Tool modules extend agent capabilities by providing reusable functions that can be shared across different agents. The main purpose of tool modules is to prevent code duplication and enable distributed execution.

Tool modules can come in several forms:

- **Web Search** 
  Access and retrieve information from the internet
- **Database Query** 
  Interact with various database systems
- **File Search**
  Find and process files efficiently
- **Custom Functions**
  Implement specialized capabilities

As shown in the diagram above, tools play a crucial role in the agent ecosystem:
1. Agents receive tasks and use LLMs for reasoning
2. Tools provide specific capabilities that agents can leverage
3. Tools can interact with environments and return results
