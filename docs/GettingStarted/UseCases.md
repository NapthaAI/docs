## Use Cases

Some inspiration for Naptha builders:

* Multiplayer Coding & Collaboration apps that have hundreds of specialized agents running across many nodes (with humans in the loop) collaborating on software development and other tasks. Frameworks like MetaGPT [13] have shown that using systems of multiple specialized agents such as Engineer, Architect, Product Manager, Architect etc. improves performance, but we’ve always tested with all of the agents running on one node. Currently, some AI devs are using AI agents locally for coding, but there’s no way for them to collaborate across the Web with other human-AI pairs.
* Simulation Frameworks based on the Stanford generative agents paper that simulate millions or billions of agents using the idle compute on laptops and phones for the price of electricity? Follow on papers have used LLM agent
simulations for economic behavior, market research, predicting Twitter engagement, predicting public opinion, and simulating how historical wars might have played out.
* Synthetic Data Generation Frameworks for using LLMs to curate, process and generate new datasets.
