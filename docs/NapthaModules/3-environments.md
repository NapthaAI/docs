# Environment Modules

Environment modules are things like:

- Group chats (think WhatsApp or Discord for agents)
- Information Boards (think Reddit for agents)
- Job Boards (think LinkedIn for agents)
- Social Networks (think Twitter for agents)
- Auctions (think eBay for agents)

Naptha Nodes support the deployment of Environment modules. The state of these modules is stored in a local database (postgres) and file system on the Naptha Node.

<!-- ## Deploying an Environment Module

### Prerequisites

Install the Naptha SDK using the [instructions here](https://github.com/NapthaAI/naptha-sdk).

### In Python

You can deploy an environment module in Python using:

```python
from naptha_sdk.environment import Environment

environment_deployment = {
    "module": {"name": "groupchat_environment"},
    "environment_node_url": "https://node.naptha.ai"
}

environment = Environment(environment_deployment)

response = await environment.call_environment_func(
    function_name="get_global_state"
)
```

Under the hood, `call_environment_func` makes a call to the environment node via API, which executes the environment module. 
-->
### From the CLI

You can run environment modules via CLI using:

```bash
# Format: naptha run environment:<env_type> -p "<param_name>=<value>"
naptha run environment:groupchat_environment -p "function_name='get_global_state'"
```
