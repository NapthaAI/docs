# Hello World

Hello World is usually used as the first function when using a new framework.

### Prerequisities

Make sure you have the Naptha SDK installed.

### Modules Used

This basic, single-node workflow is made of the following component, which you can find on the Naptha GitHub:

* [Hello World](https://github.com/NapthaAI/hello_world_agent)

## Run

You can run this "Hello World" example using the Naptha CLI with the following command:

```bash
naptha run hello_world_agent -p "firstname=Sam surname=Altman"
```

This will run the task on one node, whichever you have set as the ```NODE_URL``` in the .env file of the Naptha SDK.
